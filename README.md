# GIftastic-Star Wars GIF Party!
Love funny Star Wars gifs?  Want more?  Here is a near-infinite amount!

I had a great start to this project, as I had just learned about APIs and AJAX.  The Star Wars theme is nostalgic, but of course it is Star Wars.  I used bootstrap for my framework, and found it fun and challenging to incorporate it into JS as I was dynamically creating elements.  I had difficulty with syntax and relied on teachers and references for this difficulty, and ultimately could not figure out how to still/animate the gifs inside of the dynamically created elements in JS.  I had fun expanding my styling skills, but could not perfect the card sizing of the generated gifs. 

I had a lot of fun with this project!
